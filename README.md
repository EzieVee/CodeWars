## Optimizations

I will occassionaly go back to my solution, and look for a more concise answer. At times, I will also try to approach my solution using different methods or modern approaches.

## Lessons Learned:

No matter what your experience level, being an engineer means continuously learning. Every time you build something you always have those *whoa this is awesome* or *fuck yeah I did it!* moments. This is where you should share those moments! Recruiters and interviewers love to see that you're self-aware and passionate about growing.
