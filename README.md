## Optimizations

I will occassionaly go back to my solution, and look for a more concise answer. At times, I will also try to approach my solutions using different methods, as well as revise lines for better readability.

## Lessons Learned:

That there are multiple solutions for an question, and at times the answer isn't going to click right away, possibly even days until it does, and that's okay.
